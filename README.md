HTML website of a student study timer for BeachHacks submission

This project is based on the Pomodoro Technique, essentially a "divide and conquer" approach to studying. 
Being an engineering student myself, I know how hard it is to stay focused on all upcomong assignments. 
This website will include background information of the technique, myself and resoruces like a timer 
and music to code along to.
