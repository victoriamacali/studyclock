Here is the link to the website:

This project is based on the Pomodoro Technique, essentially a "divide and conquer" approach to studying. 
Being an engineering student myself, I know how hard it is to stay focused on all upcomong assignments. 
This website will include background information of the technique, myself and resoruces like a timer 
and music to code along to.

Utilized w3schools and freeCodeCamp projects
Used CSULB FTP to upload to the internet
